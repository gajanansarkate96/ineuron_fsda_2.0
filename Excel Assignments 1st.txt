   After opening the Excel interface, you'll typically see a blank worksheet with a grid of cells,
   a ribbon at the top containing various tabs (such as Home, Insert, Formulas, etc.), 
   and a formula bar where you can enter or edit cell contents.

(6)When to use a relative cell reference in Excel?
 Relative cell references are used when you want a formula to adjust its reference based on its position when copied or filled.
 For example, if you have a formula in cell A1 that references cell B1 (=B1), when you copy this formula to cell A2, 
 it will automatically adjust to reference cell B2 (=B2).
 Relative references are useful when you need formulas to dynamically change based on their location within the worksheet.
